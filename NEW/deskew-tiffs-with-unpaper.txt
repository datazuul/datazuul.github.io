To deskew TIFF images using the tool **unpaper**, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install unpaper**: If you don't already have it installed, you can typically find it in your package manager on Linux. For example, on Ubuntu, you can install it by running:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install unpaper
   ```

2. **Prepare your TIFF images**: Ensure your TIFF images are accessible and ready for processing.

3. **Run unpaper**: Use the `--deskew` option to correct the skew in your images. Here's an example command:
   ```bash
   unpaper --deskew input.tif output.tif
   ```
   Replace `input.tif` with the path to your input file and `output.tif` with the desired output file name.

4. **Batch processing**: If you have multiple TIFF files, you can use a loop in your terminal to process them all. For example:
   ```bash
   for file in *.tif; do
       unpaper --deskew "$file" "deskewed_$file"
   done
   ```
   This will process all `.tif` files in the current directory and save the deskewed versions with a `deskewed_` prefix.

You can use **ImageMagick's `convert`** tool to pipe a TIFF image into **unpaper** for processing. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

### 1. **Single Image Processing**
Use the `convert` command to read the TIFF file and pipe the output to `unpaper`:
```bash
convert input.tif - | unpaper --deskew - output.tif
```
- `input.tif`: The original TIFF file.
- `-`: Sends the image data as a stream to `unpaper`.
- `output.tif`: The processed and deskewed TIFF file.

### 2. **Batch Processing Multiple TIFFs**
If you have multiple TIFF files, you can loop through them:
```bash
for file in *.tif; do
    convert "$file" - | unpaper --deskew - "processed_$file"
done
```
This will process all `.tif` files in the current directory and save the output as `processed_<original filename>.tif`.

### 3. **Adjust Parameters**
You can add additional **ImageMagick** or **unpaper** options to control the processing:
- For example, to convert the image to grayscale before deskewing:
  ```bash
  convert input.tif -colorspace gray - | unpaper --deskew - output.tif
  ```
