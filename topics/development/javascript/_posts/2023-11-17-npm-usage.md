# Introduction

NPM (Node Package Manager, Hoimepage: https://www.npmjs.com/) is a tool like Maven or Gradle for managing dependencies for a Javascript project.
Maven and Gradle can download dependencies from a Maven repository. NPM downloads Javascript-dependencies from the NPM repository at https://npmjs.com/ (or other repositories).

# Usage

## Version

Check that you installed npm correctly by getting its version:

```
$ npm -v
10.1.0
```

## Initialize Project

To use npm managed packages in your javascript project, you have to initialize it with `npm init` in your project's directory.

```
$ cd npm-test-project
$ npm init
This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See `npm help init` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

Press ^C at any time to quit.
package name: (npm-test-project)
version: (1.0.0)
description:
entry point: (index.js)
test command:
git repository:
keywords:
author:
license: (ISC)
About to write to D:\projects-labs\npm-test-project\package.json:

{
  "name": "npm-test-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}


Is this OK? (yes)
$
```

We accepted all defaults.

The following `package.json` file has been created:

```
{
  "name": "npm-test-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

## Add Dependency

Dependencies are added to your project using `npm install name-of-package`:

Example: Add jQuery as dependency to your project:

```
$ npm install jquery
```

If you get this error:

```
npm ERR! The operation was rejected by your operating system.
npm ERR! It's possible that the file was already in use (by a text editor or antivirus),
npm ERR! or that you lack permissions to access it.
npm ERR!
npm ERR! If you believe this might be a permissions issue, please double-check the
npm ERR! permissions of the file and its containing directories, or try running
npm ERR! the command again as root/Administrator.
```

you might have permission error to the central download directory of your installation.
Check the permissions of the parent directories of the global `node_modules`-firectory, e.g. `D:\dev\nodejs\node_modules\npm\node_modules`.
