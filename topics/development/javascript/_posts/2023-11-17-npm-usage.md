# Introduction

NPM (Node Package Manager, Hoimepage: https://www.npmjs.com/) is a tool like Maven or Gradle for managing dependencies for a Javascript project.
Maven and Gradle can download dependencies from a Maven repository. NPM downloads Javascript-dependencies from the NPM repository at https://npmjs.com/ (or other repositories).

# Usage

## Version

Check that you installed npm correctly by getting its version:

```
$ npm -v
10.1.0
```

## Initialize Project

To use npm managed packages in your javascript project, you have to initialize it with `npm init` in your project's directory.

```
$ cd npm-test-project
$ npm init
This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See `npm help init` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

Press ^C at any time to quit.
package name: (npm-test-project)
version: (1.0.0)
description:
entry point: (index.js)
test command:
git repository:
keywords:
author:
license: (ISC)
About to write to D:\projects-labs\npm-test-project\package.json:

{
  "name": "npm-test-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}


Is this OK? (yes)
$
```

We accepted all defaults.

The following `package.json` file has been created:

```
{
  "name": "npm-test-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

## Add Dependency

Dependencies are added to your project using `npm install name-of-package`:

Example: Add jQuery as dependency to your project:

```
$ npm install jquery
```

If you get this error:

```
npm ERR! The operation was rejected by your operating system.
npm ERR! It's possible that the file was already in use (by a text editor or antivirus),
npm ERR! or that you lack permissions to access it.
npm ERR!
npm ERR! If you believe this might be a permissions issue, please double-check the
npm ERR! permissions of the file and its containing directories, or try running
npm ERR! the command again as root/Administrator.

npm ERR! A complete log of this run can be found in: C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\AppData\Local\npm-cache\_logs\2023-11-17T11_35_11_348Z-debug-0.log
```

The logfile states:

```
0 verbose cli D:\dev\nodejs\node.exe D:\dev\nodejs\node_modules\npm\bin\npm-cli.js
1 info using npm@10.1.0
2 info using node@v20.9.0
3 timing npm:load:whichnode Completed in 3ms
4 timing config:load:defaults Completed in 2ms
5 timing config:load:file:D:\dev\nodejs\node_modules\npm\npmrc Completed in 4ms
...
9 timing config:load:file:D:\projects-labs\npm-test-project\.npmrc Completed in 0ms
...
11 timing config:load:file:C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\.npmrc Completed in 1ms
...
13 timing config:load:file:C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\npm\etc\npmrc Completed in 0ms
```

We have a look into these npm config files:

* `D:\dev\nodejs\node_modules\npm\npmrc`: `prefix=${APPDATA}\npm`
* `D:\projects-labs\npm-test-project\.npmrc`: - does not exist -
* `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\.npmrc`: - does not exist -
* `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\npm\etc\npmrc`: - does not exist -

So it looks the configuration from `D:\dev\nodejs\node_modules\npm\npmrc` has been loaded, configuring `prefix` to `${APPDATA}\npm`.

In the end the problem was: company's proxy was not configured...
You can configure a proxy in `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\.npmrc` according to this documentation <https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/using-npm/config> (using "proxy", "http_proxy", "https_proxy", "no_proxy").
After this the install was successful:

```
$ npm install jquery

added 1 package, and audited 2 packages in 4s

found 0 vulnerabilities
```

Package `jquery` has been downloaded and been added to new `node_modules` folder.
The `node_modules` folder is not subject to be checked in into git (or other VCS/versioning system)! (DO NOT CHECK IN!)
If you check out from VCS, it is recreated when you execute `npm install` again.

In `package.json` jQuery has been added as dependency (`"jquery": "^3.7.1"`):

```
{
  "name": "npm-test-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "jquery": "^3.7.1"
  }
}
```

It downloaded the latest version "3.7.1". The caret "^" states that our project depends on version "3.7.1" OR HIGHER VERRSION 3.x.x.

In the newly created `package-lock.json` it has been added as dependency:

```
{
  "name": "npm-test-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "lockfileVersion": 3,
  "requires": true,
  "packages": {
    "": {
      "name": "npm-test-project",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "license": "ISC",
      "dependencies": {
        "jquery": "^3.7.1"
      }
    },
    "node_modules/jquery": {
      "version": "3.7.1",
      "resolved": "https://registry.npmjs.org/jquery/-/jquery-3.7.1.tgz",
      "integrity": "sha512-m4avr8yL8kmFN8psrbFFFmB/If14iN5o9nw/NgnnM+kybDJpRsAynV2BsfpTYrTRysYUdADVD7CkUUizgkpLfg=="
    }
  }
}
```

The `package-lock.json` is subject to be checked in! It pins the versions to exactly one version ("3.7.1"). Every time you update dependencies the lock-file changes, too, and you check it in again.

Happy NPMing!
