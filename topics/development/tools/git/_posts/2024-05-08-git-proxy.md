# How to configure GIT to use a proxy (depending on current directory)

Homepage: <https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config>

You successfully installed GIT following our previous post [GIT Basics](2024-05-08-git-proxy.md).

Now you want to configure a proxy for accessing git repositories depending on the location of the git repositories.

Let's say you have git repositories

1. accessible without proxy (inhouse)
2. accessible only through proxy (external)

To make git configuration for proxy depending on case 1) and 2) we checkout inhouse-repositories into a different directory than the external-repositories, e.g.

* inhouse repositories into "C:/Laufwerk_D/projects/"
* external repositories into "C:/Laufwerk_D/projects-ext/"

Depending on the directory we can include different gitconfig-files: for 1) without proxy and for 2) with proxy configuration.

WARNING: If you mapped a directory to a drive on a windows machine with e.g. `subst D: <mapped directory>` you have to use the underlying directory in the `gitdir` path! Just change into checked out repository and get your underlying directory by issuing `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`.

## Configuration

Edit the `.gitconfig` file in your user's home directory:

```sh
[includeIf "gitdir/i:C:/Laufwerk_D/projects/"]
	path = .gitconfig-inhouse
[includeIf "gitdir/i:C:/Laufwerk_D/projects-ext/"]
	path = .gitconfig-external
```

Create the both environment specific gitconfig-files:

File `.gitconfig-inhouse`, e.g.:

```sh
[user]
	name = Your Name
	email = ****@*****
[credential]
	helper = store
[meta]
	isLocalConfig = true
```

File `.gitconfig-external`, e.g.:

```shell
[user]
	name = Your Name
	email = ****@****
	signingkey = 7A25ASDD8FFBBAA6EF25AA51DD9C75A0D9904A0AF64
[core]
	isExternalConfig = true
[http]
	proxy = http://<ip-address>:8080
[https]
	proxy = http://<ip-address>:8080
	sslVerify = false
```
